Description: convert a filesystem into a static OCaml module (tool)
 ocaml-crunch takes a directory of files and compiles them into a
 standalone OCaml module which serves the contents directly from
 memory. This can be convenient for libraries that need a few embedded
 files (such as a web server) and do not want to deal with all the
 trouble of file configuration.
 .
 This package contains the command-line tool.
